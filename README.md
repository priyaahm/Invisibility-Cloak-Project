Invisibility Cloak using Python and OpenCV

This project demonstrates how to create a simple "invisibility cloak" effect using Python and OpenCV. The effect is inspired by the concept of an invisibility cloak(Not to mention Harry Potter!), where a specific color or background can be hidden or replaced in real-time video, making the object covered by the cloak disappear from view.
